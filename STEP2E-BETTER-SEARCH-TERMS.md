# 🔍 STEP 2E: Better Search Terms for Modern Shopify Themes

## ✅ **Great Detective Work:**
- ✅ Searched entire directory for `{{ product.price }}` - no results
- ✅ Smart to question my search term
- ✅ Modern themes use different patterns

---

## 🎯 **BETTER SEARCH TERMS TO TRY:**

### **Search Term 1: "money"**
Modern themes often use:
```liquid
| money
| money_with_currency
| money_without_currency
```

### **Search Term 2: "price"** (without the product part)
Look for:
```liquid
price
price__regular
price__sale
```

### **Search Term 3: "render"** 
Modern themes use renders:
```liquid
{% render 'price'
{% render 'product-price'
```

### **Search Term 4: "product-block-price"**
I saw this referenced in your product.json:
```liquid
product-block-price
```

---

## 🔧 **SEARCH STRATEGY:**

### **Try These Searches in Order:**
1. **Search for: `money`** (most likely to find pricing)
2. **Search for: `render 'price`** 
3. **Search for: `product-block-price`**
4. **Search for: `price__`** (with double underscore)

---

## 💡 **ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:**

### **Check for Price Snippets:**
1. **Look in snippets folder** for files with "price" in the name
2. **Look for: `price.liquid`, `product-price.liquid`, `money.liquid`**

### **Check the product.json Reference:**
From your earlier screenshot, line 57 had:
```
render 'product-block-price'
```
- **Search for: `product-block-price`**
- **This is likely the actual price display file**

---

## 📋 **STEP 2E: New Search Strategy**

### **What You Need to Do:**
1. **Search directory tree for: `money`**
2. **If that doesn't work, search for: `render 'price`**
3. **If still nothing, search for: `product-block-price`**
4. **Screenshot results and tell me what you find**

---

## 🎯 **MOST LIKELY: product-block-price**

### **From Your product.json Screenshot:**
I saw this line:
```liquid
{% render 'product-block-price', block: block, product: product, product_form_id: product_form_id, section_id: section.id -%}
```

### **This Means:**
- There's likely a **`snippets/product-block-price.liquid`** file
- **This is probably where the pricing is handled**
- **Check your snippets folder for this file**

---

## 📞 **Report Back:**
**Try these searches and tell me:**
1. **Results for searching "money"**
2. **Results for searching "product-block-price"**
3. **Check snippets folder for product-block-price.liquid**

**We're going to find that pricing code and implement the $5 wholesale discount!** 🔍🚀
