## 🔧 **STEP 4A: Preview the Development Theme**

### **What You Need to Do:**
1. **Go back to your Shopify admin** (Themes section)
2. **Find "DEV - Locksmith Replacement" theme**
3. **Click "..." → "Preview"** (DO NOT PUBLISH yet)
4. **Navigate to any product page**
5. **Take a screenshot** of the pricing display

### **What You Should See (as a regular visitor):**
- **Normal pricing** (no wholesale discount)
- **Standard product display**
- **Everything looks normal**

---

## 🧪 **STEP 4B: Test with Wholesale Customer**

### **Option 1: Login as Wholesale Customer**
1. **In the preview**, try to **login as one of your wholesale customers**:
   - Lake Geneva Country Meats
   - 15 Lakes Butcher Bistro  
   - Wannemakers

### **Option 2: Simulate Wholesale Customer**
If you can't login in preview, we can test another way by temporarily modifying the code to always show wholesale pricing.

---

## 🎯 **WHAT WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS SHOULD SEE:**

### **Expected Wholesale Display:**
- **Green discounted price**: e.g., $15.00 (bold, green)
- **Crossed-out regular price**: ~~$20.00~~ (red, strikethrough)  
- **Message**: "Save $5.00 - Wholesale" (green, small text)

### **If Product Has Compare-at-Price:**
- Shows both wholesale discount AND any existing sale pricing
- Properly handles the discount calculations
